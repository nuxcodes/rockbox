# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Rockbox is an open-source replacement firmware for digital audio players (DAPs). Written in C (gnu99) with architecture-specific assembly, it supports 80+ hardware targets across ARM, MIPS, Coldfire (m68k), and hosted platforms (SDL/Android/Linux). Licensed under GPLv2.

## Custom Build Target

This tree is being tweaked as a custom build for the **iPod Classic 6th generation** (iPod 6G). Changes may diverge from upstream Rockbox to suit this specific target.

## Build Commands

Rockbox requires out-of-tree builds. Cross-compiler toolchains are built via `tools/rockboxdev.sh`.

**Environment note:** `brew` and `sudo` are not available in this session. If a build dependency is missing, ask the user to install it manually.

```bash
# iPod Classic 6G hardware build (clean)
./build-hw.sh                # rm + mkdir + configure + make + make zip
# Or incrementally:
cd build-hw && make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) && make zip

# iPod Classic 6G simulator build
./build-sim.sh               # configure if needed + make + make install
# Or incrementally:
cd build-sim && make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
cd build-sim && ./rockboxui  # run simulator (uses simdisk/ as virtual FS)

# Non-interactive configure (reference)
../tools/configure --target=ipod6g --type=n   # hardware (Normal)
../tools/configure --target=ipod6g --type=s   # simulator

# Other make targets
make rocks                  # plugins only
make codecs                 # codecs only
make bin                    # binary only
make zip                    # create deployment zip
make reconf                 # reconfigure after tools/configure changes
make clean / make veryclean
```

**Configure build types:** (N)ormal, (S)imulator, (B)ootloader, (A)dvanced, (C)heckWPS, (D)atabase tool, (W)arble codec tool

**Sanitizers:** `--with-address-sanitizer` and `--with-ubsan` flags to configure.

**Default CFLAGS:** `-W -Wall -Wextra -Wundef -Os -nostdlib -ffreestanding -Wstrict-prototypes -pipe -std=gnu99`

## Testing

There is no unit test framework. Testing is done through:

- **UI Simulator** — the primary testing method. Builds with SDL2 and runs the full Rockbox stack on the host. Supports AddressSanitizer/UBSan.
- **Test plugins** — built via configure type `T` or in simulator mode (test_codec, test_disk, test_fps, test_mem, etc. under `apps/plugins/`)
- **CheckWPS** — validates WPS theme files (`tools/checkwps/`)
- **Warble** — host-side codec testing tool (`lib/rbcodec/test/warble.make`), built via configure with warble app type

## Architecture

### Layer Structure

```
bootloader/    — Minimal boot code, loads main firmware
firmware/      — HAL, kernel, drivers, filesystem, low-level services
lib/           — Shared libraries (rbcodec, skin_parser, fixedpoint, tlsf)
apps/          — Application layer: UI, playback engine, codecs loader, plugins, i18n
```

### Target Tree

Hardware abstraction is organized hierarchically under `firmware/target/`:
```
firmware/target/<cpu_arch>/<soc>/<manufacturer>/<model>/
```
Each target has a config header at `firmware/export/config/<modelname>.h` defining all hardware capabilities via `#define` macros. The central `firmware/export/config.h` includes an auto-generated `autoconf.h` (from configure) that selects the correct target header.

### SOURCES Files (Build System)

Source file selection uses `SOURCES` files (not per-target Makefiles). These are preprocessed with the C preprocessor, using `#ifdef` conditionals based on target config defines. This is how a single build system handles all 80+ targets. Key SOURCES files: `firmware/SOURCES`, `apps/SOURCES`, `apps/plugins/SOURCES`.

### Plugin System

Plugins are dynamically loaded `.rock` files. The API is a large struct of function pointers defined in `apps/plugin.h`, versioned so plugins must match the core. Entry point: `enum plugin_status plugin_start(const void *parameter)`.

### Codec System

Audio codecs live in `lib/rbcodec/` and are loaded as `.codec` files with their own API struct (`codecs.h`). The codec framework includes DSP processing (EQ, crossfeed, replaygain). Supports MP3, FLAC, Vorbis, Opus, AAC, ALAC, WavPack, APE, WMA, and many more.

### Memory Management

- **buflib** — Rockbox's custom compacting, handle-based allocator (`firmware/buflib*`). Two backends: `buflib_mempool` (bare-metal) and `buflib_malloc` (hosted platforms).
- **core_alloc** — Core allocation interface built on buflib.
- **TLSF** — Used for hosted/application builds (`lib/tlsf/`).

### Platform Types

1. **Native** (`PLATFORM_NATIVE`) — bare-metal firmware on real hardware
2. **Hosted** (`PLATFORM_HOSTED`) — runs atop Linux/Android (Sony NWZ, HiBy, iBasso, etc.)
3. **Simulator** (`SIMULATOR`) — SDL-based desktop simulator

### Threading

Multiple backends: native assembler threads (ARM, m68k, MIPS) with cooperative multitasking, sigaltstack threads (Linux/macOS), Win32 Fibers, SDL threads (simulator fallback).

## Code Style

- **C only** (gnu99). Assembly only when necessary for performance.
- **4-space indentation**, no tabs. 80-column line limit. Unix LF line endings. UTF-8.
- **Naming:** all lowercase for variables, functions, structs, enums. UPPER_CASE for preprocessor symbols and enum constants. No mixed case. No typedefs for structs.
- **Comments:** `/* C-style only */`. Use `#if 0` to comment out blocks. No `//` comments.
- **Function braces** on a new line. Otherwise follow existing file style.
- When editing existing code, follow the style already present in that file.

## Key Tools

- `tools/configure` — build configuration (~4900-line shell script)
- `tools/rockboxdev.sh` — cross-compiler toolchain builder
- `tools/genlang` — language file processor
- `tools/bmp2rb` — bitmap converter for Rockbox
- `tools/convbdf` — BDF font converter
- `tools/scramble` / `tools/descramble` — firmware file format tools
- `tools/buildzip.pl` — creates deployment ZIP
- `tools/voice.pl` — voice file generator (TTS)

## Release Workflow

To build, tag, and publish a release on GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Build hardware release zip
cd build-hw && make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) && make zip

# 2. Commit, tag, and push
git add <files>
git commit -m "vX.Y: description"
git tag vX.Y
git push origin master
git push origin vX.Y

# 3. Create GitHub release with the zip attached
gh release create vX.Y build-hw/rockbox.zip \
    --repo nuxcodes/rockbox --title "vX.Y" \
    --notes "Release notes here"
# Add --prerelease for alpha/beta tags
```

Releases are published at `https://github.com/nuxcodes/rockbox/releases`.

Rockpod is a [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org) fork for iPod Classic. It adds digital audio output to iPod MFi accessories over the dock connector (DACs, speakers, docks, car stereos), a rewritten PictureFlow modeled on Apple's Cover Flow, SSD-aware power management, and a streamlined menu focused on music playback.

Rockpod supports both HDD and iFlash-modded iPod Classic units. It's a drop-in replacement for the official Rockbox firmware, with no reformatting or data loss.

## Features

### Digital Audio Output

Rockpod is the first open source firmware to support digital audio output over the iPod's dock connector. It handles the full Apple iAP authentication handshake, negotiates sample rate with the accessory, and sends bit-perfect PCM over USB, bypassing the iPod's internal DAC. The entire Rockbox DSP chain (EQ, crossfeed, replaygain) is preserved in the output path.

This works with any MFi iPod dock connector accessory — DACs, speakers, docks, car stereos, and other digital audio accessories built for the iPod.

- **Full iAP/IDPS authentication** — certificate exchange, challenge-response, FID token negotiation, Digital Audio Lingo activation
- **3 MB TX ring buffer** — absorbs codec decode bursts and compensates for I2S/USB clock drift (~44,117 Hz vs 44,100 Hz)
- **Glitch-free transitions** — fade-in on play, fade-out on pause/underflow, buffer flush between tracks
- **Drift throttle** — drops 1 stereo sample when ring buffer exceeds 75% full; fires only after ~6 hours of continuous play
- **Full DSP chain preserved** — EQ, crossfeed, replaygain, stereo width all apply before the USB stream
- **HP amps auto-mute** — CS42L55 headphone amplifiers power down during USB streaming
- **USB-C compatible** — digital audio output also works with USB-C connector mods

None of this existed in Rockbox before. It required building a new protocol stack from scratch: USB Audio Class 1.0 source mode, Apple's iAP/IDPS authentication (certificate exchange, challenge-response, FID token negotiation), a custom iAP-over-USB-HID transport layer, and Digital Audio Lingo to activate streaming.

<details>
<summary><strong>Compatible devices</strong></summary>

Any iPod dock connector accessory that uses Digital Audio Lingo (0x0A) should work. The OPPO HA-2SE is the primary tested device. DACs, speakers, docks, and car stereos that accept digital audio from an iPod are all expected to be compatible.

**DACs**

- OPPO HA-2 / HA-2SE
- Sony PHA-1 / PHA-1A
- Sony PHA-2 / PHA-2A
- Onkyo DAC-HA200
- Denon DA-10
- JDS Labs C5D
- Fostex HP-P1
- Cypher Labs AlgoRhythm Solo / Solo -dB

**Speakers / Docks** — MFi-certified speakers and docks that use digital audio (not analog line-out) over the dock connector should also work.

```

The iAP HID transport handles multi-report fragmentation for large payloads (128-byte RSA signatures span multiple HID reports, reassembled via link control bytes). Transaction IDs are tracked and echoed for all post-IDPS commands.

### Cover Flow

Stock PictureFlow shows 3 slides, uses hardcoded colors, and is buried in the plugins menu. Rockpod rewrites the renderer to match Apple's Cover Flow — 7 visible slides w/ uniform tilt angle, custom theme integration, status bar toggle, faster transitions — and promotes it to a top-level menu entry.

<!-- TODO: Add before/after screenshot — stock PictureFlow vs Rockpod Cover Flow -->

|                     Cover Flow                     |                        Full-screen mode                         |
| :------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="screenshots/cover-flow.png" width="280"> | <img src="screenshots/cover-flow-no-statusbar.png" width="280"> |
|                   Status bar on                    |                     Status bar toggled off                      |

|                          Track list                          |                      Display settings                       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="screenshots/cover-flow-tracklist.png" width="280"> | <img src="screenshots/cover-flow-settings.png" width="280"> |
|             Title only — no track number prefix              |                Slide tuck, crossfade, speed                 |

- **Theme-aware colors** — slide edges and backgrounds fade toward your theme's background color, not hardcoded black
- **Status bar support** — integrates with the SBS status bar, showing "Cover Flow" in the title bar. Can be toggled off for full-screen mode
- **7 visible slides w/ parallel slide rendering** — matching Apple's Cover Flow projection
- **Configurable transition speed** — scroll and transition speeds are adjustable in display settings
- **Text crossfade** — album and artist text fades smoothly between slides instead of snapping
- **100-slot slide cache** (up from 64), Bayer-ordered dithering, 1-second background polling in SSD mode
- **Track list** shows title only — no "1.03 -" disc/track number prefixes
- **No startup delay** — the 2-second "Loading..." splash is eliminated under SSD mode

### Storage Mode

Rockpod works with both stock HDDs and iFlash SSD mods. HDD behavior is unchanged from stock Rockbox. When an SSD is detected, Rockpod switches to a lighter sleep strategy — faster wake times, lower idle power draw, and no unnecessary spin-up delays.

| Storage Mode                                         |
| :--------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="screenshots/storage-mode.png" width="280"> |
| Auto-detect, or manually select HDD / SSD            |

- **Auto-detection** via ATA IDENTIFY heuristics (rotation rate, form factor, TRIM support, CFA compliance)
- **Two-phase idle sleep** — clock-gate after 7 seconds (near-instant wake), then cut AUTOLDO after 30 seconds with backlight off
- **Instant wake from clock-gate** — no bus reset, no re-identify (<5 ms)
- **Pre-wake on backlight** — storage wakes when the screen turns on, ready before you navigate
- **HDD features bypassed** — APM and AAM skipped for SSDs
- **Plugin splash skipped** — no "Loading..." screen when load times are negligible

<details>
<summary><strong>Under the hood: sleep states</strong></summary>

| State           | What happens                                  | Wake time |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Active**      | Normal operation                              | —         |
| **Clock-gated** | ATA clock off, flash powered, GPIOs held      | <5 ms     |
| **Deep sleep**  | AUTOLDO cut, GPIOs tri-stated, controller off | ~330 ms   |

Stock HDD behavior: full power-down + re-init at ~530 ms.

Key file: `firmware/target/arm/s5l8702/ipod6g/storage_ata-6g.c`

</details>

### Power Management

- **I2S clock gating** — bus clock gated when no audio is playing
- **Codec idle power-down** — CS42L55 enters PDN_CODEC on idle, pop-free resume (master mute → power-down → 200 us settle → unmute)
- **Smart charger detection** — LTC4066 `!CHRG` pin sampled with backlight-gated timing and 500 ms settle to distinguish real chargers from weak USB sources like MFi accessories
- **Charge gate** — GPIO C1 blocks battery charging when USB can't deliver 500 mA, preventing accessory battery drain
- **Auto-poweroff with USB** — device shuts down after idle timeout even with non-charging USB connected (stock blocks poweroff indefinitely on any USB)
- **iAP idle tick** — polling drops from 10 Hz to 1 Hz after auth, saving ~9 CPU wakeups/sec

<details>
<summary><strong>Under the hood: LTC4066 charge control</strong></summary>

| GPIO      | Function          | Rockpod behavior                       |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| B6 (HPWR) | USB current limit | LOW = 100 mA, HIGH = 500 mA            |
| B7 (SUSP) | USB suspend       | Prevents any USB power draw            |
| C1        | Charge disable    | HIGH blocks charging from weak sources |

When connected to an MFi accessory without a power bank, C1 goes HIGH during backlight-off to block trickle drain. On backlight-on, C1 goes LOW to sample `!CHRG` — if charging is detected, it stays LOW.

### Simplified Menu

The main menu is reduced to five entries:

|                     Main menu                     |                    Database track list                     |
| :-----------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="screenshots/main-menu.png" width="280"> | <img src="screenshots/database-tracklist.png" width="280"> |
|                   5 menu items                    |         Title only — no disc/track number clutter          |

Removed: File Browser, Recording, FM Radio, Bookmarks, Plugins, Playlists, Shortcuts. If you need any of these back, edit `root_menu.c`.

---

### Improved UI Rendering

- **Scroll-to-start flash eliminated** — custom themes with scrolling text in the main menu would flash or flicker when the scroll position reset to the start. Rockpod fixes the viewport rendering order to prevent this, making themed menus render cleanly without visual artifacts.
- **Track name cleanup** — strips the "01 " numeric prefix that iTunes sync adds to filenames, so tracks display by their actual title across Cover Flow, Database, and WPS

---

### Bundled Theme

The repo includes a modified version of **adwaitapod_dark_simplified** with swapped play/pause button icons to reduce confusion. The theme zip is available in the [v2.0 release](https://github.com/nuxcodes/rockpod/releases/tag/v2.0). Original theme by [D00k](https://github.com/D0-0K/adwaitapod) (CC-BY-SA).

## Installation

> **Prerequisite:** Your iPod Classic must already have the Rockbox bootloader installed. See the [Rockbox installation guide](https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/RockboxUtility) if needed.

1. Download `rockbox.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/nuxcodes/rockpod/releases/latest)
2. Connect your iPod in disk mode
3. Extract the zip to the root of the iPod (creates/updates `.rockbox`)
4. Eject and reboot

PictureFlow rebuilds its album art cache on first launch after upgrade. This is automatic.

---

## Building from Source

```bash
# Hardware build (clean)
./build-hw.sh

# Incremental
cd build-hw && make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) && make zip

# Simulator
./build-sim.sh
cd build-sim && ./rockboxui
```

Cross-compiler toolchains: `tools/rockboxdev.sh`. Configure reference: `../tools/configure --target=ipod6g --type=n` (hardware) or `--type=s` (simulator).

---

## Roadmap

**Generic USB audio support via host mode.** The current support uses USB device mode — the accessory is the host and the iPod authenticates as an Apple audio source. This only works with iPod MFi accessories. The next step is USB host mode, where the iPod becomes the host and sends audio to any class-compliant UAC device — standard USB-C DAC dongles via a dock-to-OTG adapter. The S5L8702's DWC OTG controller supports host mode in hardware; the work is in the host stack and UAC class driver.

---

## Known Limitations

- **iPod MFi accessories only** — generic UAC sinks not yet supported (see Roadmap)
- **16-bit PCM, 44.1 / 48 kHz** — USB Audio Class 1.0 ceiling
- **iPod Classic only** — untested on other Rockbox targets
- **No USB DAC (sink) mode** — USB audio config is repurposed for digital audio output
- **Rockbox bootloader required** — needs an existing Rockbox installation
- **Reduced menu** — if you need the file browser or plugins menu, edit `root_menu.c`
